To run the server, type "npm install" and then finally "sails lift --port 80"

The next time you want to run the server, type "sails lift --port 80" directly without "npm install" unless you encountered an error while starting up the server

Front End Memo:
The files you need to pay attention to are:
- config/routes.js (this is where you configure the server to serve which page for which route)
- views/*.ejs (this is essentially where you put your HTMLs)
